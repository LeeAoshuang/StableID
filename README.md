### A simple, stable user identifier across devices

StableID is a simple package that helps you keep a stable user identifier across devices by leveraging [iCloud Key Value Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsubiquitouskeyvaluestore)).

It's useful for services like [RevenueCat](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios), where you may want to maintain a consistent user identifier to allow users to access their purchases across their devices, but you _don't_ want to have a complete account system or use anonymous identifiers.

StableID persists across all devices of a user's iCloud account.

## Installation

Add this repository as a Swift package.

## Before using StableID

In order to use StableID, you'll need to add the iCloud capability to your target and enable `Key-value storage`:

## Configuration

Initialize StableID:

```swift
StableID.configure()
```

If you want to provide a custom identifier:

```swift
StableID.configure(id: <optional_user_id>)
```

### Receiving updates

To receive updates when a user ID changes (for example from detecting a change from another iCloud device), configure a delegate:

```swift
StableID.set(delegate: MyClass())

class MyClass: StableIDDelegate {
    func willChangeID(currentID: String, candidateID: String) -> String? {
        // called before StableID changes IDs, it gives you the option to return the proper ID
    }
    
    func didChangeID(newID: String) {
        // called once the ID changes
    }
}
```
